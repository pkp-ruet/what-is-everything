        <h1 class="text-3xl text-center mb-4">What is the Doppler Effect?</h1>
        <img src="https://picsum.photos/800" alt="Doppler effect image" class="w-full h-auto mx-auto my-10 rounded-md">
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8 text-gray-700">The Doppler effect is a phenomenon in physics where the frequency of a wave appears to change as its source moves towards or away from an observer. This effect was first described by Christian Doppler, an Austrian mathematician and physicist, in 1842.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">How Does it Work?</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8 text-gray-700">Imagine you're standing on a train platform watching a train approach. As the train gets closer, its horn sounds higher pitched than when it's moving away from you. This is an example of the Doppler effect in action.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">Types of Doppler Effect</h2>
        <ul class="list-none mb-8 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            <li>Redshift: When a source moves away from an observer, the wavelength appears to increase.</li>
            <li>Blueshift: When a source moves towards an observer, the wavelength appears to decrease.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">Real-Life Applications</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8 text-gray-700">The Doppler effect has numerous applications in various fields such as:</p>
        <ul class="list-none mb-8 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            <li>Radars: Measure the speed of objects by detecting changes in frequency.</li>
            <li>Astronomy: Determine the velocity of celestial bodies and their distances from us.</li>
            <li>Weather forecasting: Predict weather patterns using Doppler radar technology.</li>

    <h1>What is Cryptocurrency? The Internet‚Äôs New Money</h1>

    <p>Imagine a world where you can send money to anyone, anywhere, anytime ‚Äî instantly and without a bank. Welcome to the world of <span class="highlight">cryptocurrency</span> ‚Äî digital money built for the internet age.</p>

    <p>At its core, cryptocurrency is a kind of <strong>digital currency</strong> that uses cryptography (fancy math and coding) to stay secure. Instead of being printed like dollars or managed by banks, it lives entirely online ‚Äî powered by a technology called <span class="highlight">blockchain</span>.</p>

    <p>The first and most famous cryptocurrency is <span class="highlight">Bitcoin</span>, launched in 2009. Since then, thousands of other digital coins (like Ethereum, Litecoin, and Dogecoin) have popped up ‚Äî each with its own twist.</p>

    <p>So what makes crypto special?</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Decentralized</strong> ‚Äì No single company, bank, or government controls it.</li>
      <li><strong>Borderless</strong> ‚Äì You can send or receive it globally without permission.</li>
      <li><strong>Secure & Transparent</strong> ‚Äì Thanks to blockchain, every transaction is recorded and nearly impossible to fake.</li>
      <li><strong>Limited Supply</strong> ‚Äì Many cryptocurrencies have a fixed number of coins, making them scarce (and valuable, like gold).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>People use cryptocurrency to invest, to buy things online, or to support new types of digital projects. Some see it as the future of money ‚Äî others still see it as a risky experiment. But one thing is clear: cryptocurrency is here, and it‚Äôs changing how we think about value and trust.</p>

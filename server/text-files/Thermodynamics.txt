        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">What is Thermodynamics?</h2>
        <p>Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the relationships between heat, work, and energy. It describes how energy is transferred and transformed from one form to another within a system, often involving a change in temperature.</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Key Concepts:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><code>System</code>: A collection of particles or objects that interact with each other and their surroundings.</li>
            <li><code>Thermodynamic Properties</code>: Quantities such as temperature, pressure, volume, and internal energy that describe the state of a system.</li>
            <li><code>Energy Transfer</code>: The movement of energy from one place to another due to a temperature difference or other mechanisms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Examples and Applications:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Refrigeration: A classic application of thermodynamics, where heat is transferred from a cold body to a hot body using a refrigerant.</li>
            <li>Cars: Internal combustion engines rely on the principles of thermodynamics to convert chemical energy into mechanical work.</li>
            <li>Cooling Systems: Thermodynamic cycles are used in air conditioning units and other cooling systems to transfer heat away from buildings and vehicles.</li>
        </ol>

    <section>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at an atomic and subatomic level. It's a fundamental theory in physics that explains how the tiny particles that make up our universe interact with each other.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is Quantum Mechanics?</h2>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">Quantum mechanics is a probabilistic theory, which means it can only provide probabilities of certain outcomes rather than definite answers. This is because at the quantum level, particles don't have definite positions or properties until they're observed.</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="mb-2"><code>Wave-particle duality</code>: Quantum objects can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on how we observe them.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><code>Uncertainty principle</code>: We can't know certain properties of a quantum object, like its position and momentum, simultaneously with infinite precision.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><code>Schrodinger equation</code>: A mathematical equation that describes the time-evolution of a quantum system.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-4">Examples of Quantum Mechanics in Action</h3>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">Quantum mechanics is not just a theoretical concept, it has numerous practical applications in our daily lives. For instance:</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="mb-2"><code>Transistors</code>: The building blocks of modern electronics rely on quantum mechanics to control the flow of electric current.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><code>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</code>: This medical imaging technique uses the principles of quantum mechanics to produce detailed images of the body.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><code>Lasers</code>: The light emitted by lasers is a result of quantum mechanical processes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-4">Historical Context and Development</h3>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">The concept of quantum mechanics has been evolving over the past century. Some key milestones include:</p>

        <ol>
            <li class="mb-2"><code>Max Planck's theory of black-body radiation (1900)</code>: This laid the foundation for quantum mechanics by introducing the idea that energy is quantized.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><code>Niels Bohr's atomic model (1913)</code>: This expanded on Rutherford's planetary model by incorporating quantum principles to explain atomic spectra.</li>
        </ol>

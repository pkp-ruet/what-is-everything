        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">Gravity, or gravitation, is a fundamental force of nature that causes objects with mass to attract each other. It is one of the four fundamental forces in nature, along with electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 font-bold mb-4">History of Gravity</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">The concept of gravity has been studied and described by philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians for thousands of years. Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle proposed that objects tend to move towards their natural place in the universe.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">However, it was Sir Isaac Newton who first described gravity as a universal force that affects all objects with mass in his groundbreaking book "Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica" in 1687.</p>

        <ul class="list-disc ml-8 text-lg text-gray-600">
            <li>Gravity is a force that attracts objects with mass towards each other.</li>
            <li>The strength of gravity depends on the mass and size of the objects.</li>
            <li>Gravity can be thought of as a curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects.</li>
